				<h2>1. The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
					<p>
						The World Wide Web is just a collection of <strong>files</strong> hosted on <strong>servers</strong> (computers).  These files are interpretted by <strong>web browsers</strong> that know how to make sense of <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						So...  What does that mean?  Something like this:
					</p>

					<img class="img-responsive" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IExYrdyFT_c/VBM0g6kHxpI/AAAAAAAAAOo/Uhatp5ZQAHQ/s1600/Simple%2BHTTP%2BGET%2BRequest.jpg" alt="Diagram of an http request / a series of tubes">

					<h3>Breakin' It Down</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>HTTP Get Request</strong> is what happens when you point your <strong>web browser</strong> at a web page.  <a class="easter-egg" href="dont.html" target="_blank">I.e.</a> typing <em>udacity.com</em> in your address bar on your web broswer will send an HTTP Get Request to the <strong>server</strong> that hosts Udacity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>HTTP Response Message</strong> is the server's response to your web browser saying, "Hey, gimme that webpage!"  The server replies by sending your web browser a file  that contains the information about how to display the webpage you're wanting.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Compose & Render</strong> is just the web browser's attempt at displaying the file it now has in it's possession.  It does this by interprettin the HTML/CSS in the file.
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h3>Key Points to Remember:</h3>
					<h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> has two parts to understand:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<em>Markup Language</em> is like what your 11th grade English teacher did to your research paper on Edgar Allan Poe.  She marked it up with a red pen every place that you missed a comma or didn't have your paper displaying thoughts/English in the way that she thought was appropriate.  She was <em>taggin'</em> your paper.  With HTML you will use <strong>tags</strong> to be just as gangsta as your English teacher.
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Hyper Text</em>...  Links.  That's it.
								</li> 
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (CSS) allows you to play with the style of the text and display of said research paper. Research papers were never meant to be boring black ink on white paper. They were meant to be free. My analogy might be breaking down here, but I'm sticking with it. Imagine if research pages were like Myspace and Geocities! Uhh... wait.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>More on Taggin'</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>HTML Tags</strong> come in the format of an opening bracket (less than sign) "&lt;" and a closing bracket (greater than sign) "&gt;".  They also come in two varieties:
							<ol>
								<li>
									<strong>Container Tags</strong> - Come in an opening and closing pair. Want <strong>bold</strong> text?  Just surround the text with the &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt; tags and everything <em>contained</em> within the two will be bolded.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Stand Alone Tags</strong> - These tags <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYjZK_6i37M" class="easter-egg" target="_blank">stand alone</a></em> meaning they don't need a closing tag.  Want an image on your page? Use the &lt;img&gt; tag.  No closing tag necessary.
								</li>
							</ol>
					</ul>
					<h4>Taggin' with Style</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Inline tags</strong> are what I've made liberal use of in these notes.  Every time you see text that is <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italicized</em> it's because I used an inline tag to literally alter it in the line it's on.  Generally speaking it's ok for one-off and instructional use cases, but over-use might lead the authorities to think you're a kidnapper.  So, as a general rule, try to leave inline tags with the skates.  In the 90's.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Block tags</strong> are how you make your pages sexy in the sense that newspapers are sexy.  That is to say, if you look at a newspaper it has sextions. Want a new paragraph? Use the the &lt;p&gt; tag.  Want a whole new section, like a sidebar? Use the &lt;div&gt; tag.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>2. Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
				
				<h3>Page Structure</h3>
				<p>
					When you are looking at a webpage you are not look at a seriers of tubes.  You're looking at a series of boxes that are an emergent property of the Document-Object Model.  Basically, it's a fancy way of saying your text of your page is made up of a tree that looks something like this:
				</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="http://www.webstepbook.com/supplements/slides/images/dom_tree.gif" alt="Not a sub, but a...">
				<p>
					From this tree we can use CSS to style all the different boxes or sections that we've created as the logical divisions of our page. Like in this picture where all the boxes can be moved and styled easily because of our logical approach: 
				</p> 
				<img class="img-responsive" src="img/layout.png" alt="Grid Layout">

				<h3>Text Editors & Developer Tools</h3>
				<p>
					Programmers and web developers spend a lot of time coding.  This means having tools that make that easier is of utmost importance.  There are a lot of text editors out there designed to make coding simpler.  Sumblime, Atom, Vim, etc are all good examples.  It's worth it to play with a few and see which you may like best.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another thing to get familiar with are the Developer Tools suites offered by most modern web browsers.  They make it easy to check out the code behind the page so you can see the wizard behind the curtain.
				</p>
				<h3>When in Doubt, Just Remember</h3>

				<h2>3. Adding Style to Structure with CSS</h2>
				<h3>What Does CSS Look Like?</h3>
				<p>
					CSS has the format of:
				</p>
				<code>tag .class #id {<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute1: value;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute2: value;<br>
				}
				</code>
				<p>
					With this format "tag" would represent a tag you'd want to style, ".class" would be a class name that you're defining and can apply to tags in your HTML, and "#id" would be a unique identifier for a unique element on your page.
				</p>
				<h3>What Is This Cascading Business?</h3>
				<p>
					Want more than black text on a white background?  CSS is king. Using iterative coding, saving, and refreshing CSS will allow you use and abuse your webpage until it looks almost the way you'd like.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, you have the temerity to ask about the meaning of <em>cascading</em> the context of styling sheets? Basically style can be applied in three ways: from a separate .css file, in the &lt;head&gt; section of your html file, or inline with the element in the html.  This setup works the way Tea Partiers think government should: power "cascades" down. This means that the closer the styling is to the element, the more preference given to the style.  This is all good and well, but I beseech ye to think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers" class="easter-egg" target="_blank">big picture</a>.  For practical examples of the viability of this approach of local power taken to it's logical conclusion I again cite the Tea Party, Geocities, and Myspace.
				</p>
				<h3>The Power of Laziness (Thou Shalt Not Repeat Thyself)</h3>
				<p>
					What if you had a bunch of elements on your webpage that you wanted styled similarly? You could go edit the styles of each section individually. However, I'm trying to avoid carpal tunnel.  So, I throw that style in my CSS file and then apply it wherever I please with the efficiency of a benevolent dictator.  
				</p>
				<p>
					What's more, your page should hopefully have a cohesive style that is easily edited for the <em>entire</em> page.  How?  By simply editing your CSS file.
